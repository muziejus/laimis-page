There will likely be two opportunities to say farewell to Laimis, both
scheduled for the end of June. One event will be in South Boston, and the
other will be in the New Bedford area. If you would like to be notified once
plans are finalized, please email <code>in-memory-of-laimis@desapereira.com</code>.

Information will also be updated on this page.
