An avid sports fan his entire life, Laimis loved no team more than the Boston
Bruins. Bruin legend Cam Neely, lovingly referred to as “Mr. Goal-a-game-a” in
our household, directs a foundation in his name dedicated to supporting cancer
research and care:

If you would like to make a gift to The Cam Neely Foundation in memory of
Laimis, we ask that you direct it to The Neely Cancer Fund, in memory of
“Laimis de Sa Pereira” of New Bedford, Massachusetts.
