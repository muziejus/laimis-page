# Jimmy Fund

During his illness, Laimis received care from two oncologists: [Dr. Elliott
Anderson](https://www.hawthornmed.com/our-providers/anderson/) of Hawthorn
Medical Associates and [Dr. Benjamin
Schlechter](https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/benjamin-l-schlechter/)
of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

Through the [Jimmy Fund](http://jimmyfund.org), millions of dollars have been raised for the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to support both research into defeating cancer and 
care for patients and their families. We have set up a special page in
Laimis’s memory, where you can make a donation to help the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in its mission:

http://danafarber.jimmyfund.org/goto/in-memory-of-laimis

When you donate, the text you add to “Display Name and Information” is what
will show up on the scrolling text on Laimis’s Jimmy Fund page. If you leave a “Personal
Note,” that will be sent to Laimis’s family privately.
