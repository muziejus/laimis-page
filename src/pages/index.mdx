I grew up in New Bedford, Massachusetts. I defended my dissertation “The Site
of the Novel” in January 2014, and I received my PhD from the [Department of
English Language and Literature](http://english.uchicago.edu) at the
University of Chicago in June 2014.

After living (and teaching) in Europe for six years, I was Assistant Professor
/ Faculty Fellow in the [New York University Department of
English](http://english.fas.nyu.edu/page/home) until 2018. Since then, I have
been the Research Data Librarian at [Columbia University
Libraries](http://library.columbia.edu).
