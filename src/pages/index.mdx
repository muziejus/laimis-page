Join us in remembering our beloved Laimis, 1984–2021.

LAIMIS JURGIS ARCILIO de SÁ PEREIRA was born 30 May 1984 at St. Luke’s
Hospital in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He passed away at the same Hospital on
13 May 2021, age 36.  He was the beloved son of Daiva Ona Navickas (née
Matulionytė), MT/ASCP, of New Bedford (originally from Winnipeg, Manitoba,
Canada) and Moacir de Sá Pereira, MD, of Talaíde, Cascais, Portugal
(originally from Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil). He was the grandson of Julija
Matulionienė (née Krasnickaitė) and Pranas Matulionis; and Yolanda Maria
Pompeu de Barros e Sá Pereira and Moacyr de Sá Pereira, all deceased.

He was brother to Moacir Pranas de Sá Pereira, PhD, of New York, NY; Varpas
Salvador de Sá Pereira, Major USMC (Ret.), of San Clemente, CA; Skaidrys
Elpidio de Sá Pereira, BS, of Norman, OK; Yolanda dos Anjos Andrade de Sá
Pereira, MD; and Gloria Elizabeth Conceição Andrade de Sá Pereira, MEng, both
of Lisbon, Portugal; and the late Yara da Conceição Andrade de Sá Pereira.  He
was nephew to Margis and Dobilas Matulionis and Maria Elizabeth Pompeu de
Barros e Sá Pereira da Silva. He is also survived by a nephew, five nieces,
and all the “aunts”, “uncles” and “cousins” of the extended Moreira Andrade
family of Massachusetts, Canada, and Portugal.

He was a lifetime resident of the New Bedford area, having graduated from
[Friends Academy](https://friendsacademy1810.org) and [New Bedford High
School](https://nbhs.newbedfordschools.org/). He also graduated from [Bostono
Lituanistinė Mokykla](https://www.blsm.org).  He worked at [Sid Wainer &
Son](http://sidwainer.com) until struck with a terminal illness.

Laimis loved playing games. He was a regular visitor to [The
Armoury](https://www.facebook.com/TheArmouryWargamesandHobbies/) in Fairhaven,
MA, and played tabletop and computer games with his friends and family as long
as he was able. He also ardently supported all local sports teams, especially
the Boston Bruins.
