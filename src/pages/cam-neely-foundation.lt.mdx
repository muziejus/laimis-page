# Cam Neely Foundation

An avid sports fan his entire life, Laimis loved no team more than the Boston
Bruins. Bruin legend Cam Neely, lovingly referred to as “Mr. Goal-a-game-a” in
the de Sá Pereira household, directs a foundation in his name dedicated to
supporting cancer research and care:

If you would like to make a gift to The Cam Neely Foundation in memory of
Laimis, we ask that you direct it to The Neely Cancer Fund, in memory of
“Laimis de Sa Pereira” of New Bedford, Massachusetts.
