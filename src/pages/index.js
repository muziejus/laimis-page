    <p>Join us in remembering our beloved Laimis, 1984–2021.</p>

    <p>LAIMIS JURGIS ARCILIO de SÁ PEREIRA was born 30 May 1984 at St. Luke’s
  Hospital in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He passed away at the same Hospital
  on 13 May 2021, age 36.  He was the beloved son of Daiva Ona Navickas
  (née Matulionytė), MT/ASCP, of New Bedford (originally from Winnipeg, Manitoba,
    Canada) and Moacir de Sá Pereira, MD, of Talaíde, Cascais, Portugal
  (originally from Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil). He was the grandson of Julija
  Matulionienė (née Krasnickaitė) and Pranas Matulionis; and Yolanda Maria Pompeu de
  Barros e Sá Pereira and Moacyr de Sá Pereira, all deceased. </p>

<p>He was brother to Moacir Pranas de Sá Pereira, PhD, of New York, NY; Varpas

  He was nephew to Margis and Dobilas Matulionis and Maria Elizabeth Pompeu de
  Barros e Sá Pereira da Silva. He is also survived by a nephew, five
  nieces, and all the “aunts”, “uncles” and “cousins” of the extended Moreira
  Andrade family of Massachusetts, Canada, and Portugal.</p>

<p>He was a lifetime resident of the New Bedford area, having graduated from <a

Mokykla</a>.  He worked at <a href="https://sidwainer.com/">Sid Wainer &amp; Son</a> until struck with a terminal illness. </p>

<p>Laimis loved playing games. He was a regular visitor to <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/TheArmouryWargamesandHobbies/">the Armoury</a> in Fairhaven, MA, and played tabletop and computer games with his friends and
family as long as he was able.</p>
