On May 8th, there was still a small chance that he would improve with the new
chemotherapy. We went on to talk of a summer Walt Disney World (WDW) vacation
like we had planned when he started chemo. In the summer of 1997, we went to
WDW, and it was very hot. Laimis made a song of 2 lines: “Air conditioning / What
a beautiful thing.” Remembering that trip, we sang it again, the last time we
talked.
