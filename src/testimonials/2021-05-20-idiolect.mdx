Laimis had a creative approach to language, and I think it’s safe to say that
he made the most contributions to our family’s idiolect, from our singing
“Hamburty to you” on the occasion of someone’s birthday to more recent
additions, like his use of “mìrtis,” an intentional mis-stressing of
the Lithuanian word for “death,” in place of the slang use of “RIP.” I always
think back to, however, and had the privilege of talking to him about during
his final hours, Laimis’s invented rock band, Wolf of Enemy. Long before wolf
t-shirts and posters became requirements of a hipster’s arsenal, Wolf of Enemy
had their sole hit song, “Cindy de Sá Pereira.” We would ask Laimis who Cindy
was, and he’d just smile and refuse to answer. If memory serves, there was a
second song, but its title is lost to time, and Laimis couldn’t remember it
when I asked about it.
