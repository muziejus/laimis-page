It was an honor to call Laimis my friend. I first met him years ago at work
when I transferred into the same department he was working in. He was very
welcoming and helpful during my training days within that department. It
didnâ€™t take long to quickly discover we shared many of the same interests.
Whether it was music, movies, TV shows, video games or comics, we always had
something to talk about. We spent many nights at work talking about the latest
episode of a TV show or talking about a movie we just finished watching or
just jammed out to some great music while entering orders all night. Itâ€™s
because of this and all the great laughs shared between us that made working
together at night so great. Aside from work, there were concerts he tagged
along to and local comic cons we went to together. We got to meet some great
talented artists and celebrities, and I think the nerds in both of us came out
the most during those conventions. The one thing I miss most though is our
weekly hangouts at the local game shop. Just hanging out, playing some games,
and rolling dice. Few years back we decided to check out our local game shop
and we both immediately found a new hobby and a fun community along with it.
Weâ€™d visit weekly, often multiple times a week, and just spend hours playing
different games together and with the community. Whether it be smaller quick
games or larger tournaments, we always had something to play, and it was always
a good time. And that was the one of the best qualities about Laimis: he was
just always a great person to be around. Always could make you smile and laugh
and just a good person at heart. I miss him greatly but I have many great
memories to hold onto because of him being such a great friend. Rest easy my
friend. I will continue to roll dice in your honor until we meet
again...ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²
